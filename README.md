# Gify Explorer Created Using React.JS(Redux, Context, Firebase, Compound & Styled Components) and GIPHY API

This application (Gify Explorer) was built using React (Redux, Context), Firebase & Styled Components. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in,browse & lastly the homepage. There are 2 different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners.

Google Authentication is used to sign into the application.

Authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase.

In this Application we can also download our favourite Gifs for external sharing.

The styling is all handled via styled components.

The Application is hosted using Firebase.

You can visit the Application Here: https://tinyurl.com/gifyexplorer

To run the application locally then download the source_code and redirect to the folder on terminal and type:

### npm start
